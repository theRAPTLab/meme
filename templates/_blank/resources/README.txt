# Template Resources

This folder will contain the resource files that accompany your dataset.

When editing a dataset, you will be required to provide URLs referring to resources in this folder.
The URL to place within your dataset is the path to the resource within this folder prefixed by `/`.

Example:

`<this folder>/helloworld.pdf` is referred to by the dataset URL `/helloworld.pdf`
`<this folder>/subfolder1/helloworld.pdf` is referred to by the dataset URL `/subfolder1/helloworld.pdf`
