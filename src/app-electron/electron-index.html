    If this page loads, then electron-main.js is sort of working.
    However, we are testing <strong>webpack-dev-server</strong> to see if it can load stuff.
    <h2>Boilerplate</h2>
    This file
    <pre>electron-index.html</pre> was loaded by
    <pre>electron-main.js</pre> which was spawned by
    <pre>electron ./electron-main.js</pre> when
    <pre>npm run dev</pre> invoked the script defined in
    <pre>package.json</pre> in the
    <pre>scripts</pre> section.
