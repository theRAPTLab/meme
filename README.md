# Model and Evidence Mapping Environment (MEME)

The MEME software tool is designed to help students articulate and model their understanding of scientific concepts using concept maps and evidence maps.  Concept maps have previously been used to allow students to express how the elements within a system are interrelated (Hmelo-Silver et al, 2017). Evidence maps have been successfully used to explicitly indicate how different aspects of a scientific model are grounded in disparate forms of evidence (Toth, Suthers, &amp; Lesgold, 2002). Within MEME, students will both model their understanding and indicate the sources of evidence (e.g., simulation and empirical) for specific aspects of the model. Students will also have the opportunity to rank their different sources of evidence based on their confidence level in how each source supports an aspect of their model, helping them to reflect on the relationship between evidence and models.

The software is designed to work in a classroom setting.  The core software runs as a node.js application on a server (a reasonably powered laptop will suffice).  Students log into the server via web browsers on their laptops and chromebooks.  The node.js application can be compiled and deployed as a standalone Electron application.
