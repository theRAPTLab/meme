SESSIONS

For a student to login, they need to provide their groupId at minimum.
From the groupId, the system can determine classroomId and teacherId.

groupId         - load group models, list students in group
classroomId     - view models, resources for the entire class, sentenceStarters,
                - criteria, ratinsDefinitions
teacherId       - owns a list of classroomIds
modelId         - required to load pmcdata (props, mechs, AND evidence)
resourceId      - load a specific resourceId

Students login using a TOKEN of the form NAME-HASH, encoding the groupId and
classroomId. The NAME is used to salt the HASH. If the NAME-HASH can be decoded,
it's considered a valid login and an ACCESSTOKEN is returned back to the client
on Login. The server saves decoded token to socket.USESS, and the assigned key
to ACCESSTOKEN. The token is emitted as the student's identity in all logs.

The accesstoken is a UUIDv4.

---

DATABASE AUTO NUMBERING

All ids are now numeric. After some missteps, was able to monkey-patch
graphlib so it doesn't convert numeric nodes into strings (it is an old
codebase that uses Lodash.keys(), not Object.keys(), to return props).

---

IMPLEMENTING DATA INITIALIZATION

When running the server from dev, we want to always load the hardcoded data.
When running the server from electron, we want to initialize the database.

Q. What happens with the runtime folder when making the electron build?
A. meme.app/Contents/Resources/runtime/

Q. How to tell if dev or electron?
A. npm run dev runs meme.js, which loads server.js as URSERVER, which calls
   InitializeNetwork(), StartNetwork(), and StartWebServer().
   Electron builds are invoked through app-console/console-main.js instead.

We'll start with ADMIN UPDATES

o  PKT_Update() will receive a data objects with arrays of change objects
o  It will return the array of dataobjects that were successfully transformed
o  It will set the data.error property if there was a problem

How to determine whether NET or LOCAL
ultimately this is handled at the MESSAGER and NETMESSAGE level

On the sending end

* URLINK.Call() calls MESSAGER.CallAsync(mesgName, inData, options)
* MESSAGER.CAllAsync() determines whether it goes to the network or is handled locally
* path 1: if it's a local call and there are handlers, make a Resolver Promise
* path 2: if it's a network call, make a NetMessage() and make a Transaction Promise

On the receiving end: server-network largely is a switchboard

* pkt is sent to m_HandleMessage()
* packets know how to route themselves via available socket
* a completed transaction is one that's returning from elsewhere
* otherwise see if we have any handlers available for this packet's message via m_PromiseRemoteHandlers()
* this creates a new packet transaction via PromiseTransaction(), which will return here as a ReturnTransaction()

How are messages registered?

---

ADDING CHANNEL SUPPOR TO URSYS

This ended up being too complicated to do in the timeframe, so rolled back and re-edited
these notes. The original goal:

* all messages are assumed local if no NET: is in front of message, so there is one
  interface Call, Signal, etc...
* the special channel * goes to both local and network, so no need to have LocalCall,
  NetCall, Call, if necessary

However in practice this was too difficult to easily change. So currently:

* Still require Call, LocalCall, NetCall, etc for routing
* NET: prefix is required for NetCall and NetSubscribe

Additional room for improvement:

* urlink and messager interface is still kinda messy
* server-network and ur-network should maybe share same urlink interface

Changes:

* NetNessage    new static method ExtractChannel(mesg) utility returns a
                channels object with NET, LOCAL, STATE props set.
                e.g. 'NET:MESSAGE_NAME'.

* Messager      now has a NetMessageNames() so only NetSubscribe'd messages
                are registered with the server. There is no channel-specific
                logic though. It relies on URLink to set the net, local, and
                remote-to-local-return options so it routes correctly.

* URLink        uses NET:SRV_REG_HANDLERS to register NetMessages, but otherwise
                is unchanged as the main NET, LOCAL, remote-to-local-return
                options logic is tricky and I didn't want to break it.

* netcode       server-network: URSYS interface for the server now uses
                the NetSubscribe, NetPublish, NetCall interfaces for itself.
                These are NOT used for dispatching remote messages, though,
                as that mechanism is baked into the system itself.

DATA UPDATES

Our data structures on the db side are COLLECTIONS in a LokiJS DB.
These are an in-memory data structure.

Use one of the names from DATAMAP.DBKEYS, access through DATAMAP.Collections()
for the top-level keys.

Server-implemented messages:

ADD:    NET:SRV_DB_ADD:
        IN  { 'collection': [ { }, ... ] }
        OUT { 'collection': [ { id }, ... ] }

UPDATE  NET:SRV_DB_UPDATE
        IN  { 'collection': [ { id }, ... ] }
        OUT { 'collection': [ { id }, ... ] }

REMOVE  NET:SRV_DB_REMOVE
        IN  { 'collection': [ id, ... ] }
        OUT { 'collection': [ { id }, ... ] }

DATA-MODIFYING ROUTINES

Now that these calls are available and capable of firing back their changes, we
can try implementing PMC data

BuildModel() is called whenever the properties are changed.

DATA UPDATE GENERALIZATIONS

*** Use BuildModel() to recreate the model (calls 'DATA_UPDATED' too)
*** 'DATA_UPDATED', 'ADM_DATA_UPDATED' are the main triggers for display updates

    first update BuildModel() to be called whenever a DB_SYNC event happens.
    so DBSYNC should be written first. It's in data.js hooked during INITIALIZE
    to capture NET:SYSTEM_DBSYNC

*** For PMC or ADM, use UR.DBQuery(cmd,data), where cmd is 'add', 'update', or 'remove'

---

DEBUGGING METHODS

    Now implementing them in window.ur on client side. Inspect that object from console
    to see useful commands (e.g. ur.serverinfo())

    ur.taddt    - test add teacher (uses DB ADD)
    ur.tadds    - test add student (uses DB UPDATE)
    ur.trmg     - test remove group (uses DB REMOVE)

---

NEW DATABASE METHODS

    DATAMAP is used to manage collections on the server and client. It uses
    a collection object format that looks like this:

    {
        cmd: 'update',
        teachers: [ { id:1, name:'Mrs Jones' } ]
    }

    *   Validates everything.
    *   Easily add collections to the database by just changing DBKEYS array,
        which gains ADD/UPDATE/REMOVE capabilities.
    *   Collections() returns the list of top-level collections
    *   ValidateCollections() is used before data is sent to the server to ensure
        data formats are correct (numeric ids, etc)
    *   ExtractCollections() is used by both server and client to access data
        in a loop-friendly way. It always returns docs, subDocs as arrays

    DATA now uses the 'NET:SYSTEM_DBSYNC' message to receive sync messages from
    the server. It contains the change data returned from the DB ADD, UPDATE, REMOVE
    calls. This has to be connected to the data writing methods above.

DATA MODEL NOTES

PMCDATA

    /* stored data */
    m_graph;                            // dagresjs/graphlib manager
    a_props             = [];           // all props (string index into m_graph)
    a_mechs             = [];           // all mechs (pathId string index into m_graph)

    /* derived data */
    a_components        = [];           // top-level props with no parents, derived
    h_children          = new Map();    // children hash of each prop by id
    h_outedges          = new Map();    // outedges hash of each prop by id

    a_commentThreads    = [];           // all prop and mech comments
    a_resources         = [];
    a_evidence          = [];

    h_evidenceByEvId    = new Map();
    h_evidenceByProp    = new Map();

    h_evidenceByMech    = new Map();
    h_propByResource    = new Map();
    h_mechByResource    = new Map();

ADMDATA

VIEW MODEL

    map_vprops          = new Map();
    map_vmechs          = new Map();
    map_vbadges         = new Map();
    selected_vprops     = new Set();
    selected_vmechs     = new Set();
    map_rollover        = new Map();

    array + map
    VM_Get*Changes()
    VM_*Exists(id)
    VM_Get*(id)
    VM_*Delete(id)
    VM_*Set(id,element)

PMCDATA

    to access pmcdata models, we need to grab the models collection from ADMDATA.
    The PMCDATA entities for props, mechs, evidence look like this:

    { id: 1, title: 'Fish Sim', groupId: 1, data: { ... } }

    data was {
        properties: [ { id, node, name }, ... ]
        mechanisms: [ { id, edge, source, target, name }, ... ]
        evidence: [ { id, propId, mechId, rsrcId, number, rating, note }, ... ]
        commentThreads: [ { id, refId, comments: [ {id, time, author, date,text,criteriaId, readBy: ['student','student'] }] }, ... ]
    }

    our data REFACTOR will look like this:

    data {
        entities: [ { id, type, param, param, ... } ],
        commentThreads: [ { id, refId, comments: [ {id, time, author, date,text,criteriaId, readBy: ['student','student'] }] }, ... ]
    }

    We'll have to write a new set of db routines to handle PMCdata specifically because entities
    is NOT a collection, but a subcollection, and that means we need to do a READ/MODIFY/UPDATE
    of its parent collection (pmcData)

---

WEDNESDAY - ADDING SUBKEYS

    It turns out that even with the new PMCDATA structure, we still need subkey
    modification. Ugh!

    I've added subkey support to DATAMAP

    ADD: 'pmcData.entities': { id, entities:[ { }, ... ] }    --> { id, entities:[ { id } ... ] }
    UPD: 'pmcData.entities': { id, entities:[ { id }, ... ] } --> { id, entities:[ { id } ... ] }
    REM: 'pmcData.entities': { id, entities:[ id, ... ] }     --> { id, entities:[ { id } ... ] }

    Where am I now?

    PMC_PropUpdate(propId, propData)
    ...
    UR.DBQuery('update', {
        'pmcData.entities': {
        id: modelId,
        entities: propData
    })

    .
    .
    .

    server-database UPDATE
    const collections = DATAMAP.ExtractCollections(data);
    collections.forEach
        let { colKey, docs, subKey, subDocs } = entry;
        get the pmcData collection using the docs.id property.
        After we find the matching docs.id pmcdata, we need to pull the entities out of it.
        That happens in the update() function. We can write a utility to handle this object
        in datamap.

        DITEM = pmcData model matching id

        item => {
            Object.assign(item, ditem) // normal
            // if subkey then ditem[subkey] has the items
            DATAMAP.UpdateSubCollection(data,
            const sub = DATAMAP.ExtractSubCollection(data,subkey);
        }

on the update, we get a matching item

instead of overwriting pmcmodel with entities, we want to take the matching item
and update just the subCol with subDocs

... ok, the UPDATE works... but the update object coming back is too large.

    extractCollections now provides colKey, docs, subkey, subdocs
    docs.forEach(coldata,index)
    find(...).update(match=>)
        if subKey DATAMAP.UpdateObjectProp(match,subKey,subDocs)
        else DATAMAP.AssignObject(match,newData)

... for REMOVE, we are getting a list of ids.

ur.tpropd(11) attempts to remove prop 11, which currently doesn't return the deleted thing OR delete anything yet.

... for ADD...ugh, this is just as confusing.

## TAKING A STEP BACK
## LET'S REMOVE THE MULTIPLE ITEM UPDATE CONDITIONS.

[X] -   DATAMAP.ExtractCollections still returns multiple collection objects
[X] -   DATAMAP.ExtractCollections() now returns {colkey, subkey, value} where value is
        one of the below:

    add    pmcData: value:{ ...props }
    update pmcData: value:{ id, ...props }
    remove pmcData: value:{ id }

    add    pmcData.entities: value:{ id, entities: { ...props } }
    update pmcData.entities: value:{ id, entities: { id, ...props } }
    remove pmcData.entities: value:{ id, entities: { id } }

    [X] - rewrite data.js for single use
    [X] - rewrite server-database.js for single use

---

FRIDAY CODE-ALONG

    * UR.DBQuery('cmd',{ ... }) (note: returns a promise, can chain .then(rdata=>{})
    * system then fires DATA SYNC event that calls PMCDATA or ADM SyncAddedData, SyncUpdatedDate, etc

    THE CHALLENGE: Hookup the Sync* methods for Properties!

    The result data format is different from the query data format!

    RESULT FORMAT = {
        cmd,
        collection: [ {...} ],
        collection.field: [ {...}
    }
    QUERY FORMAT = {
        cmd,
        collection: { id, ...props },
        collection.field: { id, subkey: {...props} }
    }

    WORKING ON THE PROBLEM of WRONG DRAWING SIZE....

    DEBUGGING TOO NARROW BOX
    * change VProp.DataSize() to use bbox() instead of rbox()

    DEBUGGING OUT OF SYNC ERROR
    * reproduceable now...data seems correct but load is out of sync

- - -

VProp.FindEdgePointConnectionTo(targetId)
-   finds shortest connection point to targetId
    returns {} if no line is drawable
    return { pt1, pt2 } where pt1 is the outgoing and pt2 is the destination

VProp.RequestEdgePoint(loc='c')
-   return a specified edge for center, t, r, b, or l

To spread things out, we can spread ORIGIN and DESTINATION points.
    All outgoing points can share.
    All incoming points should split

To do this, VProp.ScreenBBox() could be adapted to keep track of requests.
    Each VProp can keep track of outgoing and incoming point for l, r, t, b
    this.endPt.l = [0]; // sorted
    this.endPt.r = [0];
    this.endPt.t = [0];
    this.endPt.b = [0];

ALGORITHM
    * A is me, B is target
    * when determining the longest side, makePtObj(x1, y1, x2, y2) is used to create
    pt1(A) to pt2(B)
    * instead of makePtObj(), we ask the objects themselves to return the closest point based on our outgoing endpoint.
    * might have to increase size of prop if too many incoming elements
    * can draw a LOOP

HOW TO HANDLE LOCKS

    data = { 'pmcData.locks': { id, locks: { name, id, uaddr } };

TUE 0700

    incoming data:
    {
        uaddr:
        dbkey: 'pmcData.entities'
        dbids: [1,1]
    }
    session_locks will be created/cleared on every server restart

    1. we don't care about writing the db so much because it's memory based
    2. when a socket disconnects, cleanup by uaddr

    - to write a lock -

    UR.DBTryLock('pmcData.entities',[1,1])
    .then(status=>{
        if (!status.error) console.log('yay')
        else console.log(status.error);
    });

    UR.DBTryRelease('pmcData.entities',[1,1])
    .then(status=>{
        if (!status.error) console.log('released')
        else console.log(status.error,status.code);
    });

    the session_locks collection contains
    { semaphore: 'dbkey:dbids', uaddr }


TUE 0800 - farting around with adding codes to NetMessage

    writing Lock. expect:
        data.uaddr,
        data.dbkey
        data.dbids
    add to ursys.js
    .. add to common-ulink NetCall

TUE 0930 - do the db writes

TUE 1230 - write

THU 1830 -

  add token generation to addTeacher somewhere
  LoggedInName returns the current logged-in Name
  can SESSION report if a teacher is logged in?
  We need to know if the current session is saved
  !! this is handled in ADMData.Login under
  SESSION.DecodeAndSet(rdata.token)
  SESSION.SetAccessKey(rdata.key)

  With the teacher logged-in, the m_current_idsobj.teacherId is set
  Now we can check SESSION.LoggedInProps() to see if teacherId is set

  Now for cheeseballness, we want to look at ModelSelect

  In ModelSelect, the models are retrieved by ADM.GetModelsByStudent()

THURSDAY

    UR.ExtCall('CAPTURE_SCREEN',{ sx, sy, sw, sh}).then( href=>{
        console.log(href);
    })

    There are three parts to this:

    1. a packet format that has an action and a unique id
    2. a packet sender/callback that asyncronously sends and recognizes returning packets, calling the original caller
    3. a transport mechanism (socket, event, whatever)

    CallAsync('CAPTURE_SCREEN',{sx,sy,sw,sh})
        create new packet 'CAPTURE_SCREEN', {sx,sy,sw,sh} w/ uniqueid
        return promise that:
        .. creates a 'resolver' function that is mapped byuniqueid.
           (1) the resolver is called with the returning matching packet and
           (2) calls resolve(data) to complete the promise with returned data
           (3) sends packet

    The receiving mechanism processes the packet
    For this version, only the content.js file handles it

    TRANSPORT MECHANISM
    .

        if an incoming packet has a uniqueid in the table, it must be a returning one
